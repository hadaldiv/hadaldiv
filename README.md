i am usually off tab and tend to draw on the people around me's strawpages; my sign-off on drawings is -ultim. if you'd like to talk to me, please whisper or i most likely won't see it.

anyone is more than free to interact & i encourage it, but please be mindful that i am very anxious and have difficulty talking to new people. even so, i would love to make new friends, especially if we share interests (namely sonic). hmu!

i'm usually around the sonic area & sitting with my friends (mentioned in my bio). zen is my number 1 opp (ily /p)
